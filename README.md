# Modelling the Pandemic
Group: Bored Grad Yacht Club

The aim of this project was to model the impact of COVID-19 in Chicago neighborhoods, using sociodemographic data (age, income, education etc.) and COVID-19 statistics (hospitalizations, deaths etc.). The sociodemographic and COVID-19 data used here is for each ZIP code. Some of the explorations and visualizations we came up with is provided below.
